<h2>Introduction to RadioInfo</h2>
<p>
    You are to develop a program named RadioInfo that retrieves and displays information about the program schedules of Sweden's radio channels for radio enthusiasts. The program data should be downloaded the first time a user chooses to view the schedule of a channel. After that, it should automatically update with new data from the server either hourly or when the user manually selects to update the data. If channel data has already been displayed by the user, no new data should be downloaded when switching channels; instead, the cached data should be used.
